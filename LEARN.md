Several Searching algorithms are implemented in this repo. The list is given below:

Linear Search For Multiple Presence of an element

Linear Search For Single Presence of an element

Binary Search (Recursive)

Binary Search (Iterative)

Exponential Search

Jump Search

Interpolation Search

KMP Text Search

An example is given (commented out) in the end of the algorithms on how to use this a module. 
You are welcome to give it a try and judge and give me feedback on the parts of improvement.
